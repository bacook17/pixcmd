1. Introduction

In January 2005, the Hubble Heritage Team obtained a large 4-color mosaic image
of the Whirlpool Galaxy NGC 5194 (M51), and its companion NGC 5195, with the
Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). See
HST observing program 10452 (PI: Steven V. W. Beckwith) for details:
http://www.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/get-proposal-info?10452

The resulting color composite image was released to the community on April 25,
2005 to celebrate Hubble's 15th anniversary. Cycle 14 HST proposers were
encouraged to submit General Observer (GO) and Archival Research (AR) proposals
to complement and/or analyze this unique dataset. Since our M51 mosaics
represent a significant investment of expert processing beyond the standard
archival products, we have simultaneously released our version 1.0
drizzle-combined FITS data as a High-Level Science Product via the Multimission
Archive at Space Telescope (MAST). The version 1.0 mosaics (and possibly some
subsequently improved versions) can be downloaded from:
http://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/m51/

This README describes the key aspects of the observing program, the standard
pipeline processing, and the post-pipeline combination of these images into
complete mosaics.

With the Wide Field Channel (WFC) of the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS),
a 2x3 mosaic (6 pointings, 4 orbits per pointing) was obtained in 4 filters
(Johnson B,V,I, and H-alpha) at a telescope orient of ~270 degrees:

     Filter            Exposure time       Limiting mag*
     ---------------   ----------------    ------------
     F435W (B)         4 x 680s = 2720s    27.3 mB
     F555W (V)         4 x 340s = 1360s    26.5 mV
     F814W (I)         4 x 340s = 1360s    25.8 mI
     F658N (H-alpha)   4 x 680s = 2720s

     * for point source at S/N = 5 Johnson filters

The 6 pointings or "tiles" in the 2x3 mosaic have these central coordinates:

     Pointing     RA             DEC
     --------  -----------   ------------
     M51-POS1  13:30:02.47   +47:16:07.59
     M51-POS2  13:29:43.11   +47:15:59.64
     M51-POS3  13:30:01.82   +47:12:52.54
     M51-POS4  13:29:42.48   +47:12:44.58
     M51-POS5  13:30:01.16   +47:09:37.51
     M51-POS6  13:29:41.84   +47:09:29.51

The 4 exposures within each tile were dithered: a small sub-pixel dither
(2.5 x 1.5 pixels), and a larger dither which spans the interchip gap
(5x60 pixels), see:

2. Data calibration and registration

The standard archival data was retrieved "on-the-fly" from the archive --  after
the best calibration reference files became available -- with standard ACS
pipeline (CALACS) processing: bias, dark, and flat-field corrections. The
calibration reference files also propagate data quality flags which identify
many types of detector artifacts -- some of which will be rejected during
MultiDrizzle processing. These include bad CCD columns, hot pixels (and their
CTE tails), warm pixels, saturated pixels, etc. MultiDrizzle also applies the
latest filter-specific geometric distortion corrections to each image, as
specified in the IDCTAB reference tables produced by the ACS Team at STScI. For
further details, see the ACS  Data Handbook, (Mack et al. 2004). The latest ACS
calibration reference files, and definitions of ACS data quality flags are here:
http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/analysis/reference_files

As input to the drizzle-combination described below, we used the *_flt.fits
images. Since this dataset is not associated, the pipeline currently generates
single-image drizzled output (*_drz.fits) for each exposure. Although
MultiDrizzle was added to the ACS pipeline in 2004, it can only combine
associated datasets, and even then, it could not assemble large mosaics such as
this (which are essentially an association of associations), since they would
produce prohibitively large output files. In the standalone environment,
however, MultiDrizzle can combine any set of images, generating an association
table (*_asn.fits) for all the input  exposures. Note that this table also gets
updated with the shifts and rotations provided in the shiftfile (described
further below). For example:

--> tprint h_m51_b_s05_asn.fits col=MEMNAME,MEMTYPE,*DELTA,ROTATION

#  Table h_m51_b_s05_asn.fits[1]  Mon 17:25:10 18-Apr-2005

# row MEMNAME     MEMTYPE   XDELTA          YDELTA       ROTATION

The mosaic has six primary pointing positions (pos 1-6) or tiles:

      ____ ____ ____
     |    |    |    |
     |  2 |  4 |  6 |
     |____|____|____|
     |    |    |    |
     |  1 |  3 |  5 |
     |____|____|____|

Each position has 4 individual frames. We arbitrarily define frame 31 in pos 3
to be the origin of the  reference frame: 0,0,0

     pos1: 11,12,13,14
     pos2: 21,22,23,24
     pos3: 31,32,33,34
     pos4: 41,42,43,44
     pos5: 51,52,53,54
     pos6: 61,62,63,64

"Intertile" shifts and rotations are the (larger) shifts between positions 1-6.
These shifts can be on the order of ~10 pixels, since different guide star pairs
(or sometimes a single guide star) are used. These shifts were measured using
the geomap task, using only the first frames in each tile:

     j97c11kbq_flt.fits
     j97c21h2q_flt.fits
     j97c31rsq_flt.fits
     j97c41xkq_flt.fits
     j97c51r4q_flt.fits
     j97c61haq_flt.fits

The single-drizzled (distortion corrected *single_sci.fits) versions of these
images were generated with MultiDrizzle, in the full-mosaic output space: set
clean=no (to save the *single_sci.fits files), and avoid "corrupting" the input
flt images by setting skysub=no (don't subtract sky), and crbit=0 (don't  update
their data quality arrays).

Suitable registration objects were visually identified: they must appear in
multiple frames, be free of obvious cosmic ray contamination, not be saturated
and bleeding, and which are as star-like as possible -- most objects chosen were
unresolved compact star clusters in M51 which had a bright peak.

With imexam, we measured the x,y position of 5-10 objects in the reference frame
31, and their position in the other frames. Frames 11,41,51 have long overlaps
with frame 31, so objects were chodesn which span the full length of each
overlap:
           ____
          |    |
          | 41 |
      ____|____|____
     |    |    |    |
     | 11 | 31 | 51 |
     |____|____|____|


Frames 21 and 61 have very small overlaps with the reference frame 31, so their
shifts were measured iteratively, i.e. after the corrective shifts had been
applied to frames 11,41,51, so their overlaps with 21,61 could also be used.

The shifts and rotations were solved for using the geomap task. Once the primary
6 intertile frames were all registered to frame 31, all the other frames could
be registered to the first frame in their tile, thereby internally registering
the entire mosaic within an rms of < 0.4 pixels (relative to frame 31, not
registered to any astrometric standard). The shifts measured were
assembled into a shiftfile, to be provided to MultiDrizzle.

Since our 2-point sub-pixel dither pattern does not sample optimally in both x
and y directions, and to avoid creating prohibitively large output mosaics, we
decided to retain the input pixel scale, rather than drizzle to a finer scale.
Therefore, in these version 1.0 mosaics, only the larger intertile delta shifts
were applied (the intratile shifts are negligible at this scale -- typically no
more than 0.2 pixels).  With additional intratile registration, and with
drizzling to a finer output scale, it may be possible to extract more spatial
information from this data.

3. Rejection of cosmic rays and other artifacts

Only two of our 96 total frames exhibited non-standard artifacts (outside those
described in section 2), requiring special attention. Both of the problematic
frames were in the H-alpha (F658N) set:

A significantly elevated background level in frame j97c43n7q (in tile 4) could
not be explained by any improper bias level subtration, or any violation or
approaching of the Sun, Moon, or Earth limb avoidance angles.  This frame was
excluded from the version 1.0 combination. This leads to a uneven weight map
for H-alpha, and also leaves some cosmic ray contamination where the interchip
gaps overlap.

A broad and diffuse satellite trail is evident on chip 2 of frame j97c64roq (in
tile 6). After measuring the endpoints and width of the satellite trail in the
undistorted *single_sci.fits images, the satmask task  (Richard Hook, internal
communication) was used to generate a mask for the trail. This undistorted mask
was then transformed (using blot) into the input distorted space of the flt
images, assigned a unique flag value of 16384, and summed with the existing chip
2 data quality array: j97c64roq_flt.fits[DQ,1]

Although the rejection of cosmic rays and other undesireable artifacts is
embedded in the MultiDrizzle processing descibed below, the following is an
overview of how it is accomplished:

A median image is constructed from undistorted single-drizzled
(*single_sci.fits) images. This median image -- or the appropriate sections of
it -- are blotted back to the distorted space of the input flt images, where it
can be used to identify cosmic rays. The dither package tasks of "deriv" and
"driz_cr" are used to compare this blotted image and its derivative image with
the original input *flt.fits file, and generate a cosmic ray mask. Finally, all
the *flt.fits files, together with their newly created cosmic ray masks, are
drizzled onto a single output mosaic, which has units of electrons/second in
each pixel.

MultiDrizzle also produces weight maps, which indicate the background and
instrumental noise for each pixel in the science data. Because there is some
overlap between adjacent tiles in the mosaic, and all the bad pixels which are
rejected, the total exposure time in the final mosaic varies as a function of
position. The weight maps were visually inspected to ensure that  they showed
the pixels affected by cosmic rays and detector artifacts (and the satellite
trail) to have lower weight. It is equally important to verify  that real
objects (e.g. the cores of stars, or of the core of M51) are NOT being rejected.
The only irregular rejection was related to the long diffraction spikes and/or
bleeding (from saturation) around bright foreground stars (which is expected).

4. Image combination

The MultiDrizzle algorithm (Koekemoer et al. 2002,
HST Calibration Workshop) was used to combine the mosaics:

     - bad pixel identification
     - sky subtraction
     - drizzle each input image onto separate, registered output images
     - create a median from these images
     - transform ("blot") the median back to the frame of each input image
     - create a derivative of the median image, and compare with the
       original image to obtain a cosmic ray mask
     - refine the shifts by cross-comparing the images
     - run drizzle a second time, to combine the images with the cosmic
       ray masks into a final, combined image.

MultiDrizzle is a PyRAF script which performs the steps above on a list of input
flat-fielded ACS images (*flt.fits). However, in the standalone environment,
many more parameters can be adjusted to suit a given dataset. We describe
particular non-standard parameter settings here. These mosaics were processed in
the same environment as the pipeline, SunFire/smalls, with the following
software versions:  PyFITS 0.9.6 (November 24, 2004), numarray 1.2.3, and
MultiDrizzle 2.5.6 (25 March 2005).

Since the galaxy fills most of the mosaic, sky subtration was turned off
(skysub=no). To prevent contaminating the input data quality arrays with the
4096 flags from MultiDrizzle rejections, we set crbit=0. The cosmic ray rejection
thresholds (driz_cr_snr) were raised a bit to avoid rejecting the cores of
bright objects. The central RA,DEC and output image dimensions were fixed, and
the orientation was set to rotate north up, and east to the left. Since these
mosaics are so large, we did not build them into multi-extension FITS files,
rather the science array and weight maps are seprate files. Wet set bits=96 to
retain the warm pixels and CTE tails of hot pixels, which are flagged in the
dark reference image. We set crbit=0 to NOT add the MultiDrizzle rejection
flags (4096) to the input flt DQ arrays (the masks and weight maps still record
CRs and artifacts rejected by MultiDrizzle).

Although the lanczos3 drizzle kernel produces mosaics with the least correlated
noise, it also performs poorly in the presence of even a small amount of cosmic
ray contamination, or other artifacts with sharp edges (produces a halo of
negative pixels around them). So the gaussian kernel was used for version 1.0,
and a pattern of correlated noise is most evident as a Moire-like pattern in
the weight maps. The lanczos3 would again be considered for any subsequent versions.
For an excellent discussion of drizzle kernels, see Mei et. al, 2004.

The cosmic ray masks generated by MultiDrizzle are used as input to the  final
drizzle combination of all the images. The "drizzle" program  (Fruchter and Hook
2003) performs a weighted sum of the input images, and allows input pixels to be
shrunk by a specific amount before being mapped onto the output plane.  The
images were weighted before combination.  The weights were the inverse variance
of each exposure.

These are the complete set of MultiDrizzle parameters used:

The photometric fidelity of the MultiDrizzle code is reliable to a high degree
of accuracy, since the underlying algorithm for drizzle is designed to be
flux-conserving (see Fruchter & Hook 2002, PASP 114, 144, and Koekemoer et al.
2002, HST Calibration Workshop, p. 339). The MultiDrizzle team has verified this
in practice by using a suite of test datasets to compare photometry from
different exposures of the same objects, and verifying that these provide good
agreement to better than the ACS flatfield/photometric calibration accuracy
(1-2%) for bright sources, and Poisson noise for fainter sources. But these
version 1.0 M51 mosaics were not directly tested for photometric accuracy, nor
PSF stability across the field.

5. Files and filenaming convention:

Drizzled science data (*_drz_sci.fits) with corresponding weight maps
(*_weight.fits), in FITS format. These have a scale of 0.05 arcsec per pixel,
and have dimensions of 8600 x 12200 pixels (~420 MB each). One each for B-band
(F435W filter or "b") V-band (F555W filter or "v"), H-alpha narrow-band
(F658N filter or "h"), and I-band (F814W filter or "i"):

     h_m51_b_s05_drz_sci.fits
     h_m51_v_s05_drz_sci.fits
     h_m51_h_s05_drz_sci.fits
     h_m51_i_s05_drz_sci.fits

     h_m51_b_s05_drz_weight.fits
     h_m51_v_s05_drz_weight.fits
     h_m51_h_s05_drz_weight.fits
     h_m51_i_s05_drz_weight.fits

Low-resolution (1/4) block-averaged FITS versions of each mosaic and weight map
were also produced using the IRAF blkavg task, mainly for "quick-look"
downloading and viewing, and/or for educational purposes (not intended for
scientific analysis). These have a scale of 0.20 arcsec per pixel, and
dimensions of 2150 x 3050 pixels (~26 MB each, or 1/16 the size of the
full-resolution mosaics above):

     h_m51_b_s20_drz_sci.fits
     h_m51_v_s20_drz_sci.fits
     h_m51_h_s20_drz_sci.fits
     h_m51_i_s20_drz_sci.fits

table (*_bb.gif, looks better onscreen) and an inverted greyscale (*_igs.gif,
looks better in print):

Preview GIF (only) images of a simple "sum" combination of the B-band input
images is also provided -- mainly just to illustrate the effort necessary to
clean up and combine 24 frames into complete mosaic.  This graphic may be used
for the poster (and cover of the Proceedings) for the HST Calibration
Workshop in fall 2005:
